# WIN Backend Engineering Interview

# SOLUTION: 

## Technologies Used:

1. Language: JavaScript
2. Framework: Node.js with Express.js
3. Database: MongoDB
4. Testing: Jest with supertest

## High-level Solution Overview:

- The order management API service is built using Node.js and Express.js, which allows for the efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses.
-The service uses MongoDB as the database to store order information. Mongoose is used as the ODM (Object-Document Mapper) to interact with the MongoDB database.
- The API endpoints are defined in the Express.js router, which handles incoming requests and invokes the corresponding controller functions.
- The controllers contain the business logic for handling the order management operations, such as creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving orders.
- The solution employs middleware functions for request validation, error handling, and error responses.
- Testing is implemented using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. The supertest library is used to simulate HTTP requests and assert the expected responses.

## Trade-offs Made:

- A trade-off was made to use a simple and lightweight architecture using Node.js and Express.js for quick development and deployment. This allows for rapid iteration and scalability.
- Another trade-off was made to use an in-memory database for testing purposes instead of a full-fledged production database. This simplifies the setup and teardown of tests.

## Assumptions Made:

- It was assumed that the order information includes fields such as datetime, totalfee, and services, and these fields are required for order creation.
- It was assumed that the order ID is automatically generated by the database.

## Changes for Production:

- Enhanced error handling and logging: In a production environment, it is crucial to handle and log errors appropriately for easier troubleshooting and monitoring.
- Implement authentication and authorization: For a production-ready system, it is important to secure the API endpoints and implement user authentication and authorization to control access to the order management functionality.
- Implement pagination and sorting: As the number of orders grows, implementing pagination and sorting features would be beneficial for efficiently retrieving and managing large datasets.
- Improve testing coverage: Expand the test suite to cover more edge cases and scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability.

## Environment Setup Instructions:

1. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org) and MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com) if not already installed and install mongoDB Compass for setup DB in local machine.
2. Clone the project repository from the provided source.
3. Navigate to the project directory using the command line.
4. Install project dependencies by running the command: npm install.
5. Make a directory with name config inside root directory and two files dev.env and test.env
6. Set up the MongoDB connection by updating the MONGO_DB_URL in the .env files of the config folder.
7. Run the project using the command: npm start.
8. Run the Tests using the command: npm test.

## Spec Completion and Time Taken:

- The order management API service has been implemented with the basic functionality, including order creation, retrieval, update, and deletion, as well as preventing duplicate orders within a 3-hour time window.
- The total time taken to implement the solution approx 2-3 hours including
    database connection, handling async operations, and ensuring proper error handling and validation, and implementation of test cases.
